<h4>11 Nov: Maroochydore Cable Landing Station</h4>
<div id="cardtext">
    <p>So remember when I was in Southport, talking about that old submarine telegraph cable? It turns out South-East Queensland is entering the submarine cable game again, this time on the Sunshine Coast. The new cable connects Maroochydore to Sydney and Guam of all places—though that's not as strange as it may sound. Guam is actually a major international hub of undersea cable connectivity, owing to its location in the middle of the West Pacific...oh, and the fact that it's a US territory.</p>
    <p>Not only is Guam a strategic location for connectivity to Asia and the Pacific for the US and companies doing business there, the US military also sees it as an important location, with 29% of the island occupied by military bases. Looking at Guam on a map, its proximity to a few countries the US has (or has had) some friction with may begin to explain why that is the case. </p>
    <p>And like back in 1902, when a powerful Great Britain built and owned cables all over the world, in addition to passing through a US territory, this cable will be one of a growing number partially owned by Google.
    </p>
    <p>An unusual thing about this cable station—apart from the fact it's quite a way in from the sea—is that it stands out amongst its surroundings. Traditionally, cable stations are hidden inside unassuming or purposefully misleading looking buildings to avoid unwanted attention or sabotage. Whether this kind of 'security by obscurity' has been found not to work, or has simply been trumped by the local council's desire to showcase its location as a literal on-ramp to the information superhighway, I'm not sure. 
    </p>
    <p>Whatever the case, if you swim at Maroochydore beach in the future, take a moment to think about the 36 Terabits per second of internet traffic flowing metres beneath your feet!</p>

<h4>9 Nov: Brisbane GPO</h4>
<div id="cardtext">
    <p>Today I discovered that the first experiments with telephones in so-called Brisbane took place here at the General Post Office in 1878⁠—about 2 years after Alexander Graham Bell's initial demonstrations.</p>
    <p>The telephone was also demonstrated that year at a particularly groundbreaking Exhibition, along with the electric light (!) and electric detonation of torpedoes in the creek running through Bowen Park (a precursor to the modern Ekka fireworks show?).</p>
    
    <p>But back to the GPO. In addition to being the central Post Office, a telegraph wing was added  in 1879 and a floor was dedicated for use as the first telephone exchange in the region in 1880. During World War II, the building's front was also used as a saluting dais for military parades. </p>
    <p>And while it's telegraphic, telephonic and miltaristic days are over, the building continues to serves as an operational post office.</p>

<h4>7 Nov: The Old Windmill</h4>
<div id="cardtext">
    <p>I guess by now you're already asking "OK, which colonial power had its mitts on this particular piece of communications infrastructure?"</p>
    <p>Well, the answer to that question should be pretty obvious in this part of Meanjin. The Old Windmill (I guess just "The Windmill" back then) is the oldest surviving convict-built structure in the city. It was used for a number of purposes, not the least of which were reputed public executions and the torturous practice of  milling grain by treadmill as punishment (without trial) for gangs of prisoners. Some say there was never enough wind to mill grain on its own, others say the windmill did work but was continually in need of repair. But I digress...</p>
    <p>The windmill tower was used as a signal station to communicate (by semaphore - yep, waving red and yellow flags)  shipping information between the port and town. </p>
    <p>Railways, shipping and other industry also relied on the station for its function as a time keeping station. That ball you see at the top of the tower would drop at 1pm every day.</p>
    <p>The windmill later became a site 
    for experimentation with radio, 
    leading to Queensland's first 
    television broadcast being 
    transmitted from the tower in
    1934. Experimental broadcasts 
    continued from the tower for the following decade.

<h4>5 Nov: 20 Wharf St</h4>
<div id="cardtext">
<p>This quite conspicuous building is pretty obviously a data centre, and is one of Brisbane's busiest, since it is a 'Point of Presence' for 4 Internet eXchange Points (IXPs). IXPs are places where internet service and content providers can exchange traffic with eachother directly instead of paying someone in the middle to do so for them. IXPs are basically the 'inter' part of the internet.</p>
<p>IXPs were originally based in a single physical location, but now they often span many data centres to be able to connect more and more networks together. This building hosts 4 IXPs and about 175 individual networks connect through here to one IXP or another. A lot of medium to large sized Australian internet access providers are here, as are some big content sources like Microsoft and Cloudflare.</p>
<p>
There are about 15 other buildings in and around Brisbane just like this one, where you (or more likely your large organisation) can connect to an IXP, most of which are in the City and Valley area, with a few in Eight Mile Plains. If you want to find out more about IXPs in your areas and who is connected to them, the website PeeringDB is a good place to start!</p>

<h4>3 Nov: Bald Hills Radiator</h4>
<div id="cardtext">
    <p>As a kid growing up in neighbouring Bracken Ridge, I was kind of awestruck at the size of this huge antenna sitting in the middle of a huge empty paddock. I'd heard that it was where ABC radio was broadcast from, but I never knew how that came to be the case until recently.</p>
    <p>Up until World War II, all radio transmissions originated from the building now known as Macarthur Chambers, at the corner of Queen and Edward Streets. However, once WWII got going and General Macarthur set up shop in that building, it was thought that all those antennas made the building a pretty easy target. So in 1942 the transmitters for 4QG and 4QR were moved out here to a 43 hectare field in Bald Hills.</p>
    <p>The transmitter was (and still is) powerful enough to broadcast far beyond Australian borders, so in 1975, after 55 years of 'administration' of the Territory of New Guinea, the Australian Government commenced broadcasts to the newly independent nation of Papua New Guinea. </p>
    <p>(Does this sound familiar? The use of international communications infrastructure to reinforce colonial power?)</p>
    <p>What was not intended, however, 
    was that the transmitter's signal was so strong it drew
    complaints from India that it was causing interference with a station in Madras, and so for some time it's power had to be reduced overnight.</p>

<h4>1 Nov: 344 Queen St</h4>
<div id="cardtext">

<p>I know it's not the most exciting looking building, but it is important—at least it is to me—because all the internet traffic to and from my house passes through this building.</p>
<p>All my emails and messages, TV and movie streams, video calls, social feeds, shopping—everything. On the way out, this stuff usually passes through Sydney, and if the destination is overseas, it usually ends up being sent onward via the US west coast. </p>

<p>I guess it looks pretty nondescript, but knowing what we now know, the constant stream of white utes outside is a bit of a clue; equipment technicians of all stripes book appointments to go in and tend to their routers, switches, air conditioners, electricity generators, fire supression systems—all the stuff that makes a data center run.</p>
<p>P.S. To play into a stereotype, perhaps the Star Wars themed cafe across the street is also a clue?</p>
<p>P.P.S  How did I figure this out? In short, I ran a lot of traceroute commands and deciphered the results with the help of some research into the telecommunications industry. I'd be happy to help you decipher your own results, too:  adam@adammcfillin.net</p>

<h4>30 Oct: Southport Cable Hut</h4>
<div id="cardtext">

    <p>Here's a little bit of South-East Queensland history for you. An international submarine telegraph cable landed right here Southport in 1902⁠—part of a larger network of cables that connected colonies of the British Empire. This particular cable crossed the Pacific, passing through Norfolk Island (where it branched off to New Zealand), Fiji and Fanning Island on its way to Vancouver Island in Canada.</p>
    <p>There were already other international submarine cables to Australia (via Perth, Darwin and Bundaberg), but this one being owned wholly by the Crown apparently decreased the cost of sending inernational telegrams, not to mention keeping the Empire happy that they had complete control of communications in the event of war.</p>
    <p>P.S. I just looked up whether you can even send telegrams anymore, and you can! It’ll cost you about $30 though, so I figured the humble postcard would be just as effective.</p>
