      <h4>CIRCUITOUS CITY</h4>
      <p>
        Circuitous City is a collection of works that considers the circuit
        created betwen a sender and receiver of information. It acknowledges the
        role the creators and owners of circuits play in imbuing them with
        values (whether capitalist, imperialist or otherwise). With this in
        mind, it asks how we as users can create circuits—however long, slow,
        inconvenient or circuitous they may be—to foster the kinds of values
        that we wish to reproduce in our communities and society.

      <h4>THE ARTIST</h4>
      <p>
        Adam McFillin is an artist engaged in producing sound, installation and
        performance works that investigate power and its presence in the
        signals, protocols and infrastructure of communications networks.
        Through deconstruction and misuse, they aim to reveal the materiality of
        digital networks and the abstractions that exist between users and
        technology.<br />
